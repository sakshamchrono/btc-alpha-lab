# Palantir (PLTR) Technical Analysis and Price Targets

## Executive Summary

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is exhibiting mixed signals across various technical indicators as of late February 2026. While some short-term indicators suggest potential upward momentum, the longer-term moving averages predominantly indicate a bearish sentiment. This analysis synthesizes available data on EMAs, SMAs, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci levels, and Pivot Points to provide an advanced technical assessment.

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Moving Averages (EMAs & SMAs)

The current price of PLTR (approx. $137.19 as of Feb 28, 2026) generally trades below its longer-term moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.

*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):**
    *   10-day SMA: $133.67 (Bullish signal: Price above)
    *   50-day SMA: $161.07 - $168.08 (Bearish signal: Price below)
    *   100-day SMA: $170.37 (Bearish signal: Price below)
    *   200-day SMA: $145.45 - $161.50 (Bearish signal: Price below)
*   **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs):**
    *   5-day EMA: $134.89 (Bullish signal: Price above)
    *   20-day EMA: $142.74 (Bearish signal: Price below)
    *   50-day EMA: $36.72 - $156.91 (Discrepancy noted; newer $156.91 suggests Bearish: Price below)
    *   100-day EMA: $162.22 (Bearish signal: Price below)

**Conclusion:** The prevalence of "Sell" signals from longer-term SMAs and EMAs suggests underlying weakness, despite some short-term bullish indications from the 5-day EMA.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

The MACD indicator presents conflicting data, typical of rapidly moving stocks or differing calculation methodologies.

*   Recent MACD values range from -9.61 (Bearish) to 0.710 (Bullish) to 37.34 (Bullish) as of late February 2026.
*   The MACD line is reported to be above the signal line by some sources, indicating bullish momentum.
*   The MACD histogram turned positive around February 20, 2026, historically preceding upward trends with a notable probability (estimated 79% in past instances).

**Conclusion:** While conflicting, the recent positive MACD histogram and the MACD line being above the signal line offer a cautiously optimistic signal for short-term upward momentum.

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

The 14-day RSI values hover in a neutral to slightly oversold range, indicating a lack of strong overbought or oversold conditions.

*   RSI readings from late February 2026 range from 34.52 (Neutral) to 60.276 (Bullish).
*   A reading of 44.8 is also reported as neutral.
*   The RSI moved out of oversold territory (<30) around February 6, 2026.

**Conclusion:** The RSI suggests that PLTR is neither excessively overbought nor oversold, implying potential for sideways movement or a continuation of the current trend without immediate reversal pressure from RSI alone. The move out of oversold territory is a mild positive.

### Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands indicate that PLTR has been trading within a range, with recent readings suggesting potential for volatility.

*   **Feb 26, 2026:** Upper Band: 153.22, Lower Band: 122.41. Price is currently between these.
*   **Feb 28, 2026:** Bollinger Bands (25-period): (129.86 - 154.42) - Bearish signal as price is below the upper band, but above the lower. Bollinger Bands (100-period): (150.93 - 189.81) - Bearish signal, price is below both.

**Conclusion:** The price is trading within the wider bands but below the 100-period bands, suggesting resistance and potentially limited upside in the short term. A significant move beyond the bands would signal increased volatility.

### Fibonacci Retracement Levels

Fibonacci levels highlight potential support and resistance zones based on previous price action.

*   From a 52-week range, the **0.382 Fibonacci Retracement level is approximately $153.51** and the **0.50 level is approximately $136.82**.
*   Previous analysis (older data) identified key retracement levels at $36.01 (.382), $33.19 (.50), and $30.36 (.618). These are less relevant for current price action.
*   The current price is hovering very near the $136.82 (0.50) level.

**Conclusion:** The $136.82 level is acting as a critical inflection point. A sustained hold above this level could see a move towards $153.51, while a break below could indicate further downside.

### Pivot Points

Pivot points provide key levels for intraday and short-term trading.

*   **Classic Pivot Point (as of Feb 28, 2026):** 134.51
*   **Support Levels:** S1: 133.76, S2: ~132.50, S3: ~131.75 (approximate values based on typical calculation)
*   **Resistance Levels:** R1: 135.03, R2: ~136.28, R3: ~137.03 (approximate values based on typical calculation)

**Conclusion:** The price action around the 134.51 pivot point is crucial. Resistance at R1 (135.03) and R2 (136.28) will need to be broken for upward momentum, while support at S1 (133.76) and S2 (~132.50) could provide floors if selling pressure increases.

## Price Targets and Stop Loss

**Context:** The analysis is based on data from late February 2026. Current market conditions and future company developments can significantly alter these projections. The high valuation multiples mentioned in the fundamental analysis (P/E > 100x, P/S ~71.8x) suggest that current prices may already be pricing in substantial future growth, increasing downside risk.

### Bullish Scenario Price Targets:

1.  **Immediate Target (R2 Break):** If PLTR breaks decisively above the R2 pivot point (~$136.28) and the 0.50 Fibonacci level (~$136.82), the next target is the **0.382 Fibonacci Retracement level at $153.51**. This aligns with the upper Bollinger Band from Feb 26th.
2.  **Mid-Term Target (SMA/EMA Crossovers):** A sustained move above the 50-day SMA/EMA levels (currently around $161-$168) would signal a more robust uptrend. A target in this region would be **$165 - $170**. This would also target the 100-day SMA.
3.  **Aggressive Target (Breaking Long-Term Resistance):** Overcoming the 200-day SMA (around $145-$161) and the 100-day EMA ($162.22) could see PLTR push towards the **$180-$190** range, aligning with some of the average analyst price targets from the fundamental analysis.

### Bearish Scenario Price Targets:

1.  **Immediate Target (S1/S2 Breach):** A failure to hold the pivot point (134.51) and support at S1 ($133.76) could lead to a test of the 0.50 Fibonacci level ($136.82) from below, followed by a move towards S2 (~$132.50) and potentially the 10-day SMA ($133.67). A target here is **$130**.
2.  **Extended Downside (200-day SMA Breach):** A decisive break below the 200-day SMA (even the lower estimate of $145.45) would indicate a significant trend reversal. This could lead to a decline towards the **$110-$120** range, testing lower support structures and potentially re-testing lows seen earlier in the year.

### Stop Loss Recommendations

*   **For Long Positions (Bullish Bias):** A strict stop-loss should be placed below the critical **0.50 Fibonacci retracement level at $136.82**. A break below this level invalidates the immediate bullish thesis. An even tighter stop could be placed below the S1 pivot point ($133.76). Consider a wider stop below the 200-day SMA ($145.45) if taking a longer-term view on a breakout.
    *   **Aggressive Stop:** Below $136.82
    *   **Conservative Stop:** Below $133.76

*   **For Short Positions (Bearish Bias):** A stop-loss should be placed above key resistance levels, such as the R1 pivot point ($135.03) or the 100-day EMA ($162.22) if anticipating a deeper decline. A more immediate stop could be placed above the recent highs indicated by the upper Bollinger Band (~$154).
    *   **Aggressive Stop:** Above $135.03
    *   **Conservative Stop:** Above $154.00

### Risk-Reward Reasoning

The current price action near the 0.50 Fibonacci level and the pivot point presents a critical juncture.

*   **Bullish R:R:** A move to the $153.51 target from the current $137.19 (a ~11.9% gain) with a stop-loss below $136.82 (a ~1.7% risk) offers a favorable risk-reward ratio (approx. 7:1). A move to the $180-$190 range presents an even higher potential reward but requires breaking multiple resistance levels.
*   **Bearish R:R:** A move to the $130 target from $137.19 (a ~5.2% gain) with a stop-loss above $136.82 (a ~1.7% risk) offers a risk-reward ratio of approximately 3:1. A further decline to $110-$120 offers a significantly higher reward but also involves greater risk and a deeper bearish conviction.
