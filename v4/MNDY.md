# Monday.com (MNDY) Analysis - Advanced Technical Deep Dive

## Fundamental Analysis Summary:

Monday.com (MNDY) has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, generally exceeding expectations across recent quarters (Q4 2023 - Q4 2025), with strong Non-GAAP EPS and increasing free cash flow margins. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) has surpassed $1 billion, and the company has secured its largest deal in history. Recent AI integrations (AI Blocks, agents, Text to Filter) and new products like "monday service" are key strategic initiatives. Despite strong operational performance, a recent Q4 FY2025 earnings report showed revenue growth of +25% YoY ($333.9 million) and an FY2026 revenue guidance of $1,452M-$1,462M which fell below consensus. This, coupled with the withdrawal of 2027 targets, led to a significant stock price drop, with MNDY approaching its 52-week low.

## Advanced Technical Analysis:

**Current Trading Context:** As of late February 2026, MNDY is trading in a strong bearish trend, significantly below its historical price peaks and demonstrating high volatility. The stock price hovers around the $72.64 - $75.60 range, near its 52-week low.

**1. Moving Averages (EMAs & SMAs): Bearish Confirmation**

*   **Short-Term:** The 5-day SMA ($72.91 - $74.27) and 8-day SMA ($74.30) are close to the current price, with mixed signals but leaning towards sell. However, the 10-day EMA ($77.51) and crucially, the 20-day SMA ($83.42 - $90.64) and 20-day EMA ($85.5 - $88.03) are well above the current price, indicating strong resistance and a \"Sell\" signal.
*   **Long-Term:** The bearish trend is emphatically confirmed by longer-term averages. The 50-day SMA ($116.83 - $121.78) and 50-day EMA ($110.40 - $113.42) are substantially higher, generating \"Sell\" signals. The 100-day and 200-day SMAs (around $197.75 - $200.83 for 200-day) and EMAs (around $175.07 - $187.87 for 200-day) are vastly above the current price, reinforcing a \"Strong Sell\" outlook and indicating significant overhead resistance.

**2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Bearish Momentum**

The MACD histogram is predominantly negative, with readings around -14.70 to -0.64, signaling sustained bearish momentum. While a few isolated readings (e.g., 1.26933 from ChartMill) suggest temporary bullish shifts, the consistent negative divergence points to the stock's continued downward trajectory.

**3. RSI (Relative Strength Index): Approaching Oversold Conditions**

The 14-day RSI is hovering between 27.34 and 43.24. The lower end (27.34) indicates the stock is approaching or within oversold territory, potentially suggesting a short-term buying opportunity or a pause in the downtrend. However, an RSI of 43.24 leans towards \"Sell.\" This divergence within RSI readings themselves, and in conjunction with other bearish indicators, implies that any bounce might be short-lived without fundamental shifts.

**4. Bollinger Bands: Indicating Downtrend and Volatility**

The 25-period Bollinger Bands ($70.53 - $113.05) and 100-period Bands ($107.12 - $182.06) show the current price trading near the lower band. This configuration typically signals a strong downtrend and heightened volatility, with the price having broken below the lower band in some instances, suggesting aggressive selling pressure.

**5. Fibonacci Retracement & Pivot Points: Identifying Key Levels**

*   **Pivot Points (Classic & Fibonacci):**
    *   Central Pivot: ~$73.83 - $73.02
    *   Support Levels: S1 ($71.23 - $72.75), S2 ($67.13 - $72.58), S3 ($64.54 - $72.31)
    *   Resistance Levels: R1 ($76.39 - $77.93), R2 ($80.53), R3 ($84.63)
    These levels define immediate areas of interest for potential buying (support) or selling (resistance) pressure.

*   **Fibonacci Retracement:** Analyzing from the 52-week high ($316.98) down to the recent low ($68.68):
    *   38.2% Retracement: ~$163.53
    *   50% Retracement: ~$192.83
    *   61.8% Retracement: ~$222.13
    The current price is trading significantly below all major Fibonacci retracement levels, indicating a deep correction from its previous highs and suggesting substantial overhead resistance for any upward movement.

**6. Divergences:**
While not explicitly detailed in the search results, a sustained downtrend accompanied by a RSI near oversold could present a bullish divergence if the price makes new lows while RSI starts making higher lows. However, there is currently no strong evidence of this, and the MACD has been trending lower with price.

**Overall Technical Sentiment:** Overwhelmingly bearish. The confluence of indicators points to a strong downtrend with significant overhead resistance. Any potential short-term bounce from oversold RSI conditions is likely to face strong headwinds from the moving averages and Fibonacci resistance levels.

## Price Targets and Stop Loss:

**Rationale:** The current technical setup indicates a high probability of continued downside or sideways movement within a established downtrend. Any upward movement will face immediate and strong resistance from key moving averages and Fibonacci levels. The recent guidance reduction and withdrawal of long-term targets amplify these risks.

*   **Price Targets:**
    *   **Short-Term (1-3 Months):** With strong support at the $67-$71 range (Fibonacci S2/S3 and Classic S2/S3), a potential retest of the 52-week low around **$68.68** is plausible. If selling pressure intensifies, a breach of this level could target **$60.00**.
    *   **Medium-Term (3-6 Months):** If the bearish trend continues and the market sentiment around MNDY remains negative, targets could extend to the **$50.00 - $55.00** range, aligning with significant psychological levels and deeper Fibonacci projections (if further analysis were to reveal them).

*   **Stop Loss:**
    *   **For Current Long Positions (if any):** A tight stop loss should be placed just above the nearest resistance, ideally around **$80.00 - $82.00** (R2/R3 resistance, and above the 20-day SMA). A breach above this level would invalidate the immediate bearish outlook.
    *   **For New Short Positions:** Entry around the current price ($73-$75) with a stop loss placed above the R1 resistance level at **$78.00**. A more aggressive stop could be placed above the 20-day SMA at **$85.00**.

**Risk-Reward:**
*   **Potential Upside from current price ($73) to $68.68 (52-week low):** ~ -6%
*   **Potential Downside from current price ($73) to $60.00:** ~ -17.8%
*   **Stop Loss at $80.00:** Risk of ~ +9.6% on a short position.

The current risk-reward profile for shorting MNDY appears favorable, with a potential downside of over 17% to the $60 target compared to a ~10% risk if stopped out at $80. For long positions, the immediate downside risk to the 52-week low is ~6%, with a potential ~10% risk if stopped out at $80.
