# ServiceNow (NOW) Fundamental and Technical Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis

ServiceNow (NOW) exhibits strong fundamentals characterized by robust profitability, healthy growth prospects, and a solid financial structure, despite operating with high earnings multiples.

**Strengths:**
*   **Profitability:** ServiceNow boasts excellent profitability ratings, with high EBITDA, EBIT, Net, Profit, Operating, and Gross Margins. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) are also strong, outperforming a significant portion of its industry peers.
*   **Growth:** The company is experiencing strong growth, with projected Earnings per Share (EPS) growth of 19.44% in the next year and earnings forecast to grow 21.78% annually. In Q4 2025, ServiceNow reported 21% subscription revenue growth and a 31% non-GAAP operating margin, with 2026 guidance broadly in line.
*   **Financial Health:** While some minor concerns exist regarding its overall financial health, ServiceNow maintains a very positive debt to Free Cash Flow (FCF) ratio of 0.33, indicating high solvency, and a healthy Debt/Equity ratio of 0.12, reflecting a solid balance between debt and equity.
*   **Business Model & Strategic Focus:** ServiceNow's leadership in AI and strategic alliances are expected to boost revenue by enhancing customer reach and driving AI solution adoption.

**Weaknesses & Concerns:**
*   **High Valuation:** The company operates with high earnings multiples, including an expected P/E ratio of 47.51 for the current fiscal year and an enterprise value to sales ratio among the highest globally. It appears highly valued given the size of its balance sheet. However, it is also noted that the stock is currently trading at 35.7% below its estimated fair value.
*   **Analyst Price Target Revisions:** Over the past four months, analysts' average price targets have been significantly revised downwards.
*   **AI Impact & Market Skepticism:** While AI is a strategic focus, its adoption may slow near-term revenue growth and earnings due to the introduction of a hybrid pricing model. There's market skepticism about AI-driven growth acceleration, leading to valuation compression despite resilient fundamentals, as AI is now viewed as sustaining, not accelerating, growth. This uncertainty or perceived threat to its long-term competitive position from AI platforms could be influencing current valuations.
