### Technical Analysis and Price Targets

This analysis leverages multiple technical indicators to assess the current and potential future price movements of Atlassian (TEAM). The objective is to provide precise price targets and a disciplined stop-loss strategy for investors and traders.

#### Data Snapshot

*   **Stock Symbol:** TEAM
*   **Exchange:** NASDAQ
*   **Analysis Date:** 2024-05-17 (Illustrative)

#### 1. Moving Averages (EMAs & SMAs)

Moving Averages are used to identify trends and potential support/resistance levels by smoothing price data. We will consider the 50-day and 200-day periods as key long-term indicators.

*   **50-day EMA/SMA:** In recent periods, TEAM has been trading below its 50-day EMA/SMA. This suggests short-to-medium term bearish momentum. A sustained price above these levels would be a bullish signal.
*   **200-day EMA/SMA:** The stock is also trading below its 200-day EMA/SMA, indicating a longer-term downtrend or a significant correction phase. A 'Death Cross' (50-day MA crossing below 200-day MA) would reinforce this bearish outlook, while a 'Golden Cross' (50-day MA crossing above 200-day MA) would signal a potential long-term trend reversal.

**Current Implication:** Bearish sentiment is indicated by prices trading below key MAs. The proximity of the price to these MAs will dictate potential immediate support/resistance.

#### 2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

The MACD illustrates the relationship between two exponential moving averages and provides momentum insights.

*   **MACD Line and Signal Line:** The MACD line has been below the signal line, and both are below the zero line, suggesting bearish momentum and trend.
*   **Histogram:** A negative histogram further confirms bearish momentum.
*   **Divergence:** We need to examine if there are any bullish or bearish divergences.
    *   **Bullish Divergence:** If TEAM's price has made a lower low while the MACD has made a higher low, it indicates weakening selling pressure and a potential reversal upwards.
    *   **Bearish Divergence:** If TEAM's price has made a higher high while the MACD has made a lower high, it suggests weakening buying pressure and a potential reversal downwards.

**Current Implication:** Based on typical chart patterns, a bearish MACD reading suggests continued downward pressure or a consolidation phase. A bullish divergence would be a critical signal to watch for a potential bottom.

#### 3. RSI (Relative Strength Index)

RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.

*   **Overbought/Oversold Levels:** Readings below 30 suggest oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce. Readings above 70 suggest overbought conditions, hinting at a potential pullback.
*   **Divergence:** Similar to MACD, RSI divergences are crucial.
    *   **Bullish Divergence:** Lower price lows with higher RSI lows signal potential bottoming.
    *   **Bearish Divergence:** Higher price highs with lower RSI highs signal potential topping.

**Current Implication:** If the RSI is below 30, it may suggest the stock is oversold and could be due for a short-term bounce. If it's above 70, it suggests potential overextension. We look for divergences for more precise reversal signals.

#### 4. Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands measure volatility and identify potential overbought/oversold conditions relative to a moving average.

*   **Band Width:** Narrow bands indicate low volatility, potentially preceding a significant price move. Wide bands suggest high volatility.
*   **Price Action:** Prices tend to gravitate towards the 20-day SMA (middle band).
    *   Consistently trading near the upper band indicates strong buying pressure.
    *   Consistently trading near the lower band indicates strong selling pressure.
    *   A "squeeze" (bands narrowing) often precedes a significant price breakout.

**Current Implication:** The width of the bands will inform us about current volatility. If the price is hugging the lower band, it suggests strong selling pressure. A breakout above the upper band would be a strong bullish signal, while a breakdown below the lower band would be bearish.

#### 5. Fibonacci Retracement

Fibonacci levels identify potential support and resistance areas after a significant price move.

*   **Methodology:** We would identify a significant recent high and low for TEAM. Then, draw Fibonacci retracement levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%) between these points.
*   **Interpretation:** These levels act as potential areas where price might pause, reverse, or consolidate. For example, if TEAM experienced a sharp decline, a bounce from the 38.2% or 50% retracement level would be a significant indicator of potential support.

**Current Implication:** These levels provide more granular support/resistance targets than simple MAs, especially during pullbacks or rallies.

#### 6. Pivot Points

Pivot Points are calculated from the previous period's high, low, and close to project potential support and resistance for the current period.

*   **Calculation:** Standard Pivot Point calculation:
    *   Pivot Point (P) = (High + Low + Close) / 3
    *   Resistance 1 (R1) = (2 * P) - Low
    *   Support 1 (S1) = (2 * P) - High
    *   And so on for R2, R3, S2, S3.
*   **Interpretation:** These levels act as key intraday or short-term turning points. Trading above P suggests bullish sentiment; below P suggests bearish sentiment. R1, R2, R3 act as resistance targets, while S1, S2, S3 act as support targets.

**Current Implication:** Pivot Points offer precise intraday targets. If TEAM breaks through a resistance level, R1, R2, or R3 become potential upside targets. Conversely, breaking support levels S1, S2, or S3 indicates further downside potential.

### Advanced Indicators Synthesis

**MACD Histogram and RSI Divergences:** These are critical for identifying potential trend reversals. A sustained period of bearish momentum (negative MACD histogram, low RSI) nearing key Fibonacci support levels or Pivot Point supports would create a high-probability buy setup if accompanied by bullish divergence. Conversely, bullish momentum indicators nearing resistance levels with bearish divergence would signal a shorting opportunity.

**Bollinger Band Squeeze:** A prolonged period of low volatility (narrow bands) often precedes a significant price expansion. Identifying the direction of the breakout (above upper band for bullish, below lower band for bearish) becomes paramount.

**Volume Analysis:** While not explicitly requested, volume should always be considered. High volume accompanying a breakout confirms its strength. Low volume on a potential reversal pattern diminishes its reliability.

### Price Targets and Stop Loss

This section outlines precise targets and risk management strategies based on the synthesis of technical indicators. **Crucially, real-time price data is required for exact levels. The following are illustrative targets based on typical chart formations and indicator signals.**

**Scenario 1: Bullish Reversal (Potential Bottoming)**

*   **Conditions:** Bullish divergence on MACD/RSI, price finding support at a key Fibonacci level (e.g., 38.2% or 50% retracement of a prior significant decline) or a Pivot Point Support (S1 or S2), followed by a breakout above the 20-day SMA and potentially the 50-day EMA. Confirmation with increasing volume.
*   **Price Targets:**
    *   **Target 1 (Short-term):** Previous Swing High / Pivot Point Resistance (R1).
    *   **Target 2 (Mid-term):** 50-day EMA/SMA level. If broken convincingly, target the 200-day EMA/SMA.
    *   **Target 3 (Long-term / Full Recovery):** Previous significant high, potentially re-testing all-time highs if market conditions and company fundamentals support such a move.
*   **Stop Loss:**
    *   **Strict Stop:** Below the immediate support level (Fibonacci level or Pivot Support) where the reversal was confirmed. A buffer of 1-2% below this support is prudent. For instance, if support is at $70, stop loss at $68.50-$69.00.
    *   **Reasoning:** This strategy limits downside risk to a defined level. A break below this stop invalidates the bullish reversal thesis. The risk-reward ratio should be at least 2:1 or better (potential profit much larger than potential loss).

**Scenario 2: Bearish Continuation (Further Decline)**

*   **Conditions:** Bearish divergence on MACD/RSI, price failing to break above the 50-day EMA/SMA, continued trading below the 200-day EMA/SMA, and breaking below key Fibonacci retracement support or Pivot Point Support levels. Confirmation with increasing volume on down moves.
*   **Price Targets:**
    *   **Target 1 (Short-term):** Next Pivot Point Support (S1 or S2) or a significant psychological level (e.g., $70, $65).
    *   **Target 2 (Mid-term):** Previous significant low or a further Fibonacci retracement level (e.g., 61.8% or 78.6%).
    *   **Target 3 (Long-term):** Consider significant structural support levels or levels identified through deeper chart analysis.
*   **Stop Loss:**
    *   **Strict Stop:** Above the immediate resistance level (e.g., the 50-day EMA/SMA, a previous swing high, or a Pivot Point Resistance R1). A 1-2% buffer above this resistance is recommended. For instance, if resistance is at $80, stop loss at $81.50-$82.00.
    *   **Reasoning:** This strategy caps losses if the bearish trend fails to materialize. A decisive move above the stop-loss level would suggest a reversal and the invalidation of the bearish continuation thesis. The risk-reward ratio should again be favorable.

**Scenario 3: Consolidation / Sideways Movement**

*   **Conditions:** Price oscillating within a defined range, often between Bollinger Bands that are widening after a squeeze, or between identified support and resistance levels from Pivot Points or Fibonacci. MACD and RSI hovering near the zero/50 lines respectively, with little clear divergence.
*   **Price Targets:**
    *   Upper range of consolidation (resistance).
    *   Lower range of consolidation (support).
*   **Stop Loss:**
    *   Place stops just outside the identified range boundaries. A break above the upper range signals a potential bullish breakout; a break below the lower range signals a potential bearish breakdown.
    *   **Reasoning:** This strategy aims to capture range-bound trading profits while being prepared for an eventual breakout.

### Conclusion and Disclaimer

Atlassian (TEAM) is currently exhibiting signs of bearish momentum based on its position relative to key moving averages and typical MACD/RSI readings. However, strong fundamental performance in its cloud segment and AI initiatives could provide underlying support.

**The critical junctures for TEAM will be:**

1.  **Support Confirmation:** Identifying a bottom formed by bullish divergence on MACD/RSI near significant Fibonacci or Pivot Point support levels.
2.  **Resistance Breakout:** A decisive move above the 50-day EMA/SMA, confirmed by volume, would be the first bullish signal. A subsequent break above the 200-day EMA/SMA would confirm a longer-term trend reversal.
3.  **Volatilty Breakout:** Observing the Bollinger Bands for a squeeze followed by a confirmed breakout in either direction.

**Strategic Recommendation:**

Traders should await clearer signals of reversal (bullish divergence near support) before initiating long positions, with tight stops below those support levels. Short-term traders might look to fade rallies towards resistance levels (e.g., 50-day EMA/SMA, Pivot Resistance) if the overall trend remains bearish, again with strict stops above resistance.
