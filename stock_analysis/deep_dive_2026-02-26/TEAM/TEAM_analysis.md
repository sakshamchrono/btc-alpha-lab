## 1) Fundamental analysis

## Business and growth profile
Atlassian remains a high-quality software platform asset (Jira, Confluence, Service Management, Loom, Rovo/AI layer), but the stock has undergone extreme derating. Fundamental operating momentum is still positive:

- **FY2025 revenue:** **$5.215B**, up **19.66% YoY** (StockAnalysis financials)
- **TTM revenue:** **$5.76B**, up **20.13% YoY** (StockAnalysis financials/statistics)
- **Q2 FY26 shareholder letter highlights (company source):**
  - Revenue **$1.6B**, **+23% YoY**
  - Cloud revenue **$1.1B**, **+26% YoY**
  - RPO **$3.8B**, **+44% YoY**
  - Cloud NRR **120%+**

Interpretation: core topline + enterprise adoption signal remains strong; this is not a classic demand-collapse profile.

## Profitability and margins
Atlassian still shows a GAAP profitability gap, but strong cash conversion:

- **Gross margin (TTM): 84.06%**
- **Operating margin (TTM): -2.25%**
- **Net margin (TTM): -3.29%**
- **FCF margin (TTM): 22.25%**
- **FCF (TTM): $1.282B**

View: margins reflect ongoing product/platform investments (including AI and enterprise go-to-market), while FCF profile indicates underlying economic strength.

## Balance sheet quality
From StockAnalysis statistics:

- **Cash & equivalents:** $1.57B
- **Total debt:** $1.22B
- **Net cash:** **+$351M**
- **Current ratio:** 0.89
- **Debt/Equity:** 0.76

Balance sheet is not distressed; net cash plus strong FCF materially lowers solvency risk versus highly levered software names.

## Valuation and peer context
TEAM appears inexpensive versus its own multi-year history and many software peers on sales-based multiples:

- **TEAM P/S (TTM): ~3.35** (StockAnalysis statistics; CompaniesMarketCap also reports ~3.54 as of Feb 2026)
- **TEAM EV/Sales: ~3.29**
- **TEAM Forward P/E: ~14.44** (not always stable due GAAP loss optics / estimate sensitivity)

Peer P/S snapshots (CompaniesMarketCap, Feb 2026):
- **ServiceNow (NOW): 8.28**
- **Salesforce (CRM): 4.53**
- **Snowflake (SNOW): 13.2**

Conclusion on valuation: TEAM trades at a deep discount to premium growth software despite still-healthy growth and FCF generation. Key caveat: market may be pricing in sustained deceleration + margin uncertainty.

## 2) Technical analysis

Data source: Stooq daily OHLCV through **2026-02-25**.

## Trend and moving averages
- **Close:** $73.19
- **SMA20:** $93.37
- **SMA50:** $126.73
- **SMA200:** $165.66

Price is far below all key moving averages, with strong bearish long/medium trend structure.

## Momentum (RSI / MACD)
- **RSI-14:** **22.66** (deep oversold)
- **MACD (12,26):** -15.852
- **Signal (9):** -15.277
- **Histogram:** -0.575

Momentum is bearish with oversold characteristics; countertrend bounces are possible, but trend confirmation is absent until price reclaims at least 20D/50D levels.

## Returns and volatility
- **1M return:** -47.13%
- **3M return:** -50.02%
- **6M return:** -55.44%
- **1Y return:** -74.25%
- **Annualized realized volatility:** ~50.5%

This is a high-volatility, drawdown-regime asset currently.

## Support / resistance
- **Near support:** $67.85 (recent/52w zone)
- **Near resistance:** ~$93-95 (20D MA zone), then $126-127 (50D MA)
- **Broader overhead resistance:** ~$138.85 (1M high), then ~$166 (200D MA)

Base technical read: structurally bearish until higher highs/higher lows form and at least 50D is reclaimed.

## 3) Quant/statistical scenario modeling (12-month target)

## Framework used
Price target triangulates:
1. Revenue path (FY26/FY27 run-rate implied by recent growth),
2. Exit valuation multiple (P/S / EV/S range),
3. Risk-adjusted probability weighting.

Given current market regime, we use conservative multiple assumptions vs historical software peaks.

### Scenario assumptions

### Bear case (25% probability)
- Revenue growth slows materially (mid-teens to low-teens trajectory)
- Multiple stays compressed (~2.8x sales)
- Sentiment remains risk-off toward unprofitable-GAAP software
- **Target: $58**

### Base case (50% probability)
- Growth remains resilient (~16-20%) with continued enterprise/cloud traction
- Margins gradually improve; FCF remains >20% margin
- Multiple partly normalizes toward ~4.0x sales
- **Target: $95**

### Bull case (25% probability)
- AI/product monetization and enterprise expansion drive re-acceleration
- Clearer operating leverage and estimate upgrades
- Multiple rerates toward ~5.5x sales (still below prior-cycle extremes)
- **Target: $136**

## Probability-weighted expected value
Expected 12M value ≈ **$96** (close to base case), implying about **+31%** from $73.19.

## 4) Max drawdown risk estimate (1-year horizon)

## Historical analogs (from TEAM price history)
- **Full-history max drawdown:** **-84.98%**
- **Worst rolling 1Y-window drawdown:** **-76.95%**

## Forward-looking scenario drawdown assumptions
- **Bear regime:** -55% to -65% peak-to-trough possible
- **Base regime:** -30% to -40%
- **Bull regime:** -20% to -30%

## Estimated 1-year max drawdown (probability-weighted)
- **Central estimate:** **~45%**
- **Stress tail risk:** can extend toward **60-75%** in severe risk-off / guidance-shock conditions.

## 5) Key risks, assumptions, limitations

## Key risks
- AI competition compressing software pricing power
- Cloud/enterprise growth deceleration from macro weakness
- Prolonged GAAP profitability gap keeps multiple depressed
- Execution risk in cross-sell/platform monetization
- Market technical damage can persist longer than fundamentals

## Core assumptions in this analysis
- Financial snapshots from public aggregators and company communications are directionally accurate
- Stooq price history is sufficiently accurate for technical/statistical calculations
- Scenario valuation uses simplified sales-multiple framework (not full DCF)

## Limitations / data-confidence notes
- SEC direct filing fetch was blocked (403 automated-access policy), so SEC primary-text validation was partially constrained.
- Some third-party valuation pages show minor inconsistencies across fields; where this occurs, values were triangulated and stated as approximate.
- This is an analytical model, **not investment advice**.
