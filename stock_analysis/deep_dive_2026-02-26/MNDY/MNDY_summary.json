  "thesis": "MNDY combines elite gross margins, strong net-cash balance sheet, and robust FCF generation. The stock has undergone severe derating, and if high-teens growth is sustained with stable-to-slightly improved valuation multiples, 1-year expected value is positive. However, volatility and drawdown risk remain very high.",
  "risk_flags": [
    "High realized volatility and deep historical drawdowns",
    "Potential growth deceleration vs guidance",
    "Valuation multiple compression risk in SaaS",
    "GAAP profitability still fragile vs non-GAAP strength",
    "Primary IR data access partially constrained by anti-bot protections"
