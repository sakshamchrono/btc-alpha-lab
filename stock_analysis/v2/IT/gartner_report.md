## Technical Analysis

As of February 17, 2026, the technical indicators for Gartner (IT) present a predominantly bearish outlook.

*   **Indicators:** While some indicators offer mixed signals (RSI, MACD), others like ADX (53.16) and ROC (-32.97) strongly suggest a sell-off.
*   **Recent Performance:** The stock has experienced substantial volatility, with a ~70% decline over the past year, but has shown some recovery in the last four weeks.

## Quantitative & Statistical Analysis

*   **Volatility:** Gartner has exhibited high volatility, with weekly volatility around 8% over the past year. A sharp 20.9% drop occurred on February 3, 2026, following weak guidance. Its 52-week range was approximately $139.18 to $507.79.
*   **Beta:** Gartner's 5-year beta ranges from 1.04 to 1.38, indicating it tends to be slightly more volatile than the overall market.

**1-Year Price Target Scenarios (Current Price ~$148.33):**
*   **Bear Case (30% probability):** $130 - $140. Driven by continued AI disruption fears and failure to meet growth expectations.
*   **Base Case (50% probability):** $160 - $180. Reflects stabilization and partial recovery towards analyst targets, with successful AI integration.
*   **Bull Case (20% probability):** $190 - $220. Assumes strong execution, successful AI adaptation, and overcoming market headwinds.

**Estimated Maximum Drawdown (1-Year):**
*   Given the historical ~70% annual drawdown and recent volatility, a further drawdown of **15% to 25%** from current levels (to $110-$125) is plausible in a bearish scenario. The extreme downside potential observed historically cannot be ignored.
