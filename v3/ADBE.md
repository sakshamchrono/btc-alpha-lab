ADBE Analysis:

Fundamental Analysis:
- Strong Q4 FY2025 results, exceeding expectations.
- Positive FY2026 guidance with revenue and EPS targets.
- Significant AI integration (Firefly) and strategic partnerships.
- Faces competition from AI tools, leading to analyst downgrades and stock price pressure.
- High institutional ownership.

Technical Analysis:
- Predominantly bearish signals from moving averages.
- Pivot point near $255.37, resistance around $256-257, support near $253-254.
- RSI mixed, some oversold signals.
- MACD generally bearish momentum.

Price Target & Stop Loss (Based on current data):
- Price Target: $290 (representing a bounce from oversold conditions, aiming for the 200-day MA which is around $348, but conservatively targeting prior support/resistance levels and analyst targets).
- Stop Loss: $245 (below recent lows and key Fibonacci support, anticipating a further breakdown if the $253-254 support fails).

Reasoning:
- The stock is trading below key moving averages, indicating bearish sentiment. However, oversold RSI conditions suggest a potential short-term bounce.
- The price target considers the current bearish trend but factors in potential recovery driven by AI momentum and analyst price targets.
- The stop loss is set to mitigate further downside risk if the stock breaks key support levels.
